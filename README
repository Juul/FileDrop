  Introduction

    This is a Javascript library for reading files into
    browser memory and/or background uploading using
    multi-file drag-drop.

    This library makes use of HTML5/Javascript/CSS only.

    Supported (tested) browsers so far:

      Firefox 4 (3.6 may work but not tested)
      Chrome 13 (earlier may work, but not tested)

      Safari 5.1 on Mac OS:
        File drag-drop and uploading works.
        File reading (into js memory) does not work.

      Safari 5.1 on Windows:
        Tested and does NOT work.

  Checking browser capabilities:

    To check if FileDrop supports the current browser, run:

      FileDrop.support();

    It will return true if the browser is supported, and
    false if it is not.

    To check if file reading is supported use:

      FileDrop.readSupport();

    It will return true if file reading is supported for the
    current browser, and false if not.

    To check if background file uploading is supported use:

      FileDrop.uploadSupport();

    It will return true if uploading is supported for the
    current browser, and false if not.

  Basic usage:

    Drag-drop file uploading can be activated for an html
    element using:

        FileDrop.create('my_element_id', {
                        url: '/foo/upload',
                        read_files: true,
                        upload_files: true,
                        client_side_zip: true,
                        hover_class: 'my_css_class'});


    The file will be uploaded as if it was uploaded using
    a good old-fashioned:

      <form action='/foo/upload' method='POST'>
        <input name='file' type='file' />
        <input type='submit' value='Submit'>
      </form>
   
    my_element_id is the id of the element to activate
    as a file drop-zone.

    The read_files parameter specifies that files should
    be read into js memory when dropped onto the element.
    
    The upload_files parameter specifies that files should
    be uploaded to the given url when dropped onto the
    element.

    At least one of these two parameters (read_files
    or upload files must be true in order to use the 
    FileDrop library. If one or both of these parameters 
    are specified, then the unspecified parameters will 
    be set to true if the browser supports them and 
    false if not.

    The client_side_zip parameter specifies whether
    received zip files should be extracted client side.
    If this is true, then all zip files will be extracted,
    discarding directory structure, and the extracted 
    files will be treated as if they had been received
    normally. Nested zip files will be extracted and
    handled in the same way.

    To use client_side_zip, you will need
    the js-unzip library written by August Lilleaas:

      https://github.com/augustl/js-unzip

    To handle _compressed_ zip files you also need
    the js-inflate library, written by Masanao Izumo
    and August Lilleaas:

      https://github.com/augustl/js-inflate/

    These two libraries will allow FileDrop to handle
    the following zip archive compression methods:

      * No compression: Rarely used.
      * DEFLATE: The most common zip file compression.

    Note: The current version of FileDrop does not
          support mime-type detection of the files
          archived in zip files, which means that
          you can only filter compressed/archived
          files by extension, _not_ by mime-type.

  Callback API:

    To use the FileDrop API, first instantiate:

      var f = FileDrop.create(...);

    The callback API is documented using commented examples:

    /* 
      Called when a file is disallowed based on allow or 
      disallow rules. The rules variable is an array of 
      the rules that triggered the disallow.
      An empty array means that the file was disallowed
      because the default is to disallow and no specific
      allow rule matched.
    */
    f.on_disallowed_file = function(file, rules) {
      console.log("File " + file.name + " was disallowed based on " + rules.length + " rules");

    }

    /* 
      Called when a file is allowed based on allow or 
      disallow rules. The rules variable is an array of 
      the rules that triggered the allow.
      An empty array means that the file was allowed
      because the default is to allow and no specific
      disallow rule matched.
    */
    f.on_allowed_file = function(file, rules) {
      console.log("File " + file.name + " was allowed based on " + rules.length + " rules");
    }

    /*
      Receiving a file (client side) is about to begin
    */
    f.on_receive_begin = function(files) {
      console.log("Some files were dropped! (actually " + files.length + ")");
    };

      }

    /*
      Upload of files is about to begin.
    */
    f.on_upload_begin = function(files) {

    };

    /*
      Upload of all dropped files has completed.
    */

      Use this to update e.g. an upload progress bar.

      E.g. the user clicked 'stop' in the browser or hit escape.
    */
    f.on_upload_aborted = function() {
      console.log("Upload aborted.");
    };

    /*
      Happens when the compression method used for a file in
      an archive is not supported.

      console.log("Error decompressing file '" + file.name + "' in archive '" + file.parent_archive.name + "': " + msg);

    };

  Filtering:
      
    You can specify either an allow or a disallow parameter.
    You must not specify both.
    These parameters are both an array of one or more rules.

    If allow is specified, only files matching one or more 
    of the rules are allowed.

    If disallow is specified, only file matching one or more
    of the rules are disallowed.

    If not filters are specified, all files are allowed.

    A rule is a hash that looks something lige e.g:

      {mime_type: 'image/jpeg', extension: 'jpg'}

    You can omit either mime_type or extension, but not both.

    If the above rule is used like so:

    FileDrop.create('droparea', {

      allow: [
        {mime_type: 'image/jpeg', extension: 'jpg'}
      ]
    });

    Then only files with the image/jpeg mimetype and the
    extension 'jpeg' will be allowed.

    Extensions and mimetypes are matched case-insensitive.
