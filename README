  Introduction

    This is a Javascript library for reading files into
    browser memory and/or background uploading using
    multi-file drag-drop.

    This library makes use of HTML5/Javascript/CSS only.

    Supported (tested) browsers so far:

      Firefox 4 (3.6 may work but not tested)
      Chrome 13 (earlier may work, but not tested)

      Safari 5.1 on Mac OS:
        File drag-drop and uploading works.
        File reading (into js memory) does not work.

      Safari 5.1 on Windows:
        Tested and does NOT work.

  Checking browser capabilities:

    To check if FileDrop supports the current browser, run:

      FileDrop.support();

    It will return true if the browser is supported, and
    false if it is not.

    To check if file reading is supported use:

      FileDrop.readSupport();

    It will return true if file reading is supported for the
    current browser, and false if not.

    To check if background file uploading is supported use:

      FileDrop.uploadSupport();

    It will return true if uploading is supported for the
    current browser, and false if not.

  Basic usage:

    Drag-drop file uploading can be activated for an html
    element using:

        FileDrop.create('my_element_id', {
                        url: '/foo/upload',
                        read_files: true,
                        upload_files: true)

    The file will be uploaded as if it was uploaded using
    a good old-fashioned:

      <form action='/foo/upload' method='POST'>
        <input name='file' type='file' />
        <input type='submit' value='Submit'>
      </form>
   
    my_element_id is the id of the element to activate
    as a file drop-zone.

    The read_files parameter specifies that files should
    be read into js memory when dropped onto the element.
    
    The upload_files parameter specifies that files should
    be uploaded to the given url when dropped onto the
    element.

    At least one of these two parameters must be true in
    order to use the FileDrop library. If one or both
    of these parameters are specified, then the 
    unspecified parameters will be set to true if the
    browser supports them and false if not.

  Callback API:

  Filtering:
      
    You can specify either an allow or a disallow parameter.
    You must not specify both.
    These parameters are both an array of one or more rules.

    If allow is specified, only files matching one or more 
    of the rules are allowed.

    If disallow is specified, only file matching one or more
    of the rules are disallowed.

    If not filters are specified, all files are allowed.

    A rule is a hash that looks something lige e.g:

      {mime_type: 'image/jpeg', extension: 'jpg'}

    You can omit either mime_type or extension, but not both.

    If the above rule like so:

    FileDrop.create('droparea', {

      allow: [
        {mime_type: 'image/jpeg', extension: 'jpg'}
      ]
    });

    Then only files with the image/jpeg mimetype and the
    extension 'jpeg' will be allowed.

    Extensions and mimetypes are matched case-insensitive.
