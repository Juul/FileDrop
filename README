  Introduction

    This is a Javascript library for reading files into
    browser memory and/or background uploading using
    multi-file drag-drop.

    This library makes use of HTML5/Javascript/CSS only.

    Supported (tested) browsers so far:

      Firefox 4 (3.6 may work but not tested)
      Chrome 13 (earlier may work, but not tested)

      Safari 5.1 on Mac OS:
        File drag-drop and uploading works.
        File reading (into js memory) does not work.

      Safari 5.1 on Windows:
        Tested and does NOT work.

  Checking browser capabilities:

    To check if FileDrop supports the current browser, run:

      FileDrop.support();

    It will return true if the browser is supported, and
    false if it is not.

    To check if file reading is supported use:

      FileDrop.readSupport();

    It will return true if file reading is supported for the
    current browser, and false if not.

    To check if background file uploading is supported use:

      FileDrop.uploadSupport();

    It will return true if uploading is supported for the
    current browser, and false if not.

  Basic usage:

    Drag-drop file uploading can be activated for an html
    element using:

        FileDrop.create('my_element_id', {
                        url: '/foo/upload',
                        read_files: true,
                        upload_files: true,
                        hover_class: 'my_css_class',
                        client_side_zip: true});


    The file will be uploaded as if it was uploaded using
    a good old-fashioned:

      <form action='/foo/upload' method='POST'>
        <input name='file' type='file' />
        <input type='submit' value='Submit'>
      </form>
   
    my_element_id is the id of the HTML element activate 
    as a file drop-zone, and is the only required 
    parameter. All other parameters are optional.

    The read_files parameter specifies that files should
    be read into js memory when dropped onto the element.
    
    The upload_files parameter specifies that files should
    be uploaded to the given url when dropped onto the
    element.

    At least one of these two parameters (read_files
    or upload files must be true in order to use the 
    FileDrop library. If one or both of these parameters 
    are specified, then the unspecified parameters will 
    be set to true if the browser supports them and 
    false if not.

    The hover_class parameter specifies a CSS class that
    will be added to the drop-zone element when the
    cursor hovers over the element while files are being
    dragged. The CSS class will be removed from the
    element again when the cursor no longer hovers
    over the element, or, if the files are dropped,
    after the file receive, upload or receive+upload
    has been completed.

    The client_side_zip parameter specifies whether
    received zip files should be extracted client side.
    If this is true, then all zip files will be extracted,
    discarding directory structure, and the extracted 
    files will be treated as if they had been received
    normally. Nested zip files will be extracted and
    handled in the same way.

    To use client_side_zip, you will need
    the js-unzip library written by August Lilleaas:

      https://github.com/augustl/js-unzip

    To handle _compressed_ zip files you also need
    the js-inflate library, written by Masanao Izumo
    and August Lilleaas:

      https://github.com/augustl/js-inflate/

    These two libraries will allow FileDrop to handle
    the following zip archive compression methods:

      * No compression: Rarely used.
      * DEFLATE: The most common zip file compression.

    Note: The current version of FileDrop does not
          support mime-type detection of the files
          archived in zip files, which means that
          you can only filter compressed/archived
          files by extension, _not_ by mime-type.

  Filtering:

    With filtering you can allow or disallow certain
    types of files from being received and/or uploaded.
    Filtering works by setting either the allow or
    disallow parameter when calling create.

    var f = FileDrop.create('filedrop', {
                          url: '/bar/upload',

                          allow: [{
                            mime_type: 'image/jpeg',
                            extension: 'jpg'
                          },{
                            extension: 'txt'
                          }]
                         });

    If allow is specified, only files matching one or more 
    of the rules are allowed.

    If disallow is specified, only file matching one or more
    of the rules are disallowed.

    If no filters are specified then all files are allowed.

    You must never specify both allow and disallow parameters
    for the same call to create.

    The allow and disallow parameters are both an array of 
    one or more rules.

    A rule is a hash that looks something lige e.g:

      {mime_type: 'image/jpeg', extension: 'jpg'}

    You can omit either mime_type or extension, but not both.

    If the above rule is used like so:

    FileDrop.create('droparea', {

      allow: [
        {mime_type: 'image/jpeg', extension: 'jpg'}
      ]
    });

    Then only files with the image/jpeg mimetype and the
    extension 'jpeg' will be allowed.

    Extensions and mimetypes are matched case-insensitive.

  Callback API:

    To use the FileDrop API, first instantiate:

      var f = FileDrop.create(...);

    The callback API is documented using commented examples:

    /* 
      Called when a file is disallowed based on allow or 
      disallow rules. The rules variable is an array of 
      the rules that triggered the disallow.
      An empty array means that the file was disallowed
      because the default is to disallow and no specific
      allow rule matched.
    */
    f.on_disallowed_file = function(file, rules) {
      console.log("File " + file.name + " was disallowed based on " + rules.length + " rules");

    }

    /* 
      Called when a file is allowed based on allow or 
      disallow rules. The rules variable is an array of 
      the rules that triggered the allow.
      An empty array means that the file was allowed
      because the default is to allow and no specific
      disallow rule matched.
